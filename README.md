## [Live Demo](https://sunny-froyo-646110.netlify.app/)

## Overview

Emotion Detection from Text is a simple web application that analyzes text to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the emotions conveyed in a text. It's an ideal beginner project to explore NLP and backend API handling in Python with a front-end interface in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Analyze text input to detect emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger.
- Real-time display of emotion results along with an emoji representation.
- Minimalistic and responsive front-end design.
- RESTful API backend for emotion analysis.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Basic structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the page, including a dark gradient background and button styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handling user input, interacting with the backend, and updating the UI.

### Backend
- **Python (Flask)**: RESTful API for emotion detection.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Text processing and emotion classification.
- **TextBlob**: Used for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.
- **CORS**: Enabled using Flask-CORS to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.
